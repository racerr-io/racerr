Implemented Photon multiplayer (beta).

1.8.0
Moved to Unity 2018.3.x.
Implemented batched raycast system for ground detection resulting in greatly improved performance, esp. with high ground detection resolution.
Improvements to the demo scene.
Ignore Raycast layer is ignored by default without need to tick it.

1.7.4
Fixed vehicle freezing when going sideways with 0 forward velocity.

1.7.3

Last shift time is now private so that it does not get copied over when copying the component field values at runtime.
Make manual searchable.
Blinker component creates warning on every frame when clip size is zero.
Switch to Seans water instead of standard to avoid warnings on import.

1.7.2
	
Greatly improved wheel stability at high caster angles and when hitting obstacles far off center.
Fixed being able to enter disabled vehicles if vehicle was disabled during runtime.
Added ‘Freeze when inactive’ option. ‘Freeze when still’ will now only work when player is in the vehicle. This is to prevent other vehicles behaving as rocks when hit by player and ‘Freeze when still’ is enabled. Also fixes other vehicles not taking damage.
Reset gauges to default values after exiting the vehicle.

1.7.1
Fixed vehicle accelerating in reverse after throttle released (1.7 bug)
No actions are needed on import to make demo scene work anymore.
Removed all external dependencies so that standard assets are no longer required.
Changed FPS character controller and fixed character controller getting stuck on objects.
Changes to make WC3D more stable at 0.02 fixed delta time.
Added fallback to default hard-coded inputs in case input manager is not set up.

1.7
Added warning with explanation if inputs have not been set on import.
Split vertical input.
Add different options for switching from forward to reverse and back.
Added “Run On Enable” and “Run On Disable” to engine options.
Fix “Run On Startup” gets ignored by Activate() function.
Fix engine stop sound not being played when vehicle is deactivated.
Manual flip over option added.
IK driver compatibility.
CTS compatibility.
[Demo Scene] Fix semi rear axle jump when trailer detached.

1.6
Fixed vehicles jumping / flying into the air under some specific circumstances.
Add option to freeze the vehicle when inactive.
Improved tracked vehicles.
Added Damage.Repair() function.
Fixed bug where Mobile Input Manager would throw error if Vehicle Controller was not assigned, and Vehicle Changer was.
Vehicles with larger wheels sometimes hesitate when changing from reverse to first gear.
Error when detaching the trailer in some cases.
Solved emissive meshes not emitting in demo scene build (thank you SilverSho0t).
Fixed RPM being off on the RPM gauge inside the demo scene.
Remove leftover tutorial scene.
Removed delay when shifting from reverse to forward.

1.5
Changed the look of demo scene and added new auto-generated telemetry and settings menus.
Added unit converter with common conversions.
Fixed fuel consumption calculation which would result in too high fuel consumption.
Added per-vehicle option for skidmark textures.
Metrics system that provides values such as drift time, top speed, average speed, …
Removed “skidSmoothing” field for skid sound component and changed the way skid sound is calculated.
Added vehicle braking when still and not throttle applied.
Fixed trailer not being attachable in demo scene due to the wrong trailer tag.
Option for reverse lights.
Changed code for stability assist to allow for drifting at lower settings
Added drift assist.
Changed the name of Driving Aid to Driving Assist
Updated manual.

1.4
Tracked vehicle support along with a new demo vehicle - Type 10 MBT.
Fixed a bug where axle RPM would be reported incorrectly resulting in vehicles having less power and requiring lower final gear ratio.
Improved lateral friction calculation - eliminated high speed instability.
Fixed Automatic transmission staying  in 2nd gear instead of changing to 1st in some cases.
Changed the way low beam / high beam light switching works.
Added ‘Ignore Tags’ field to the damage handler. Collisions with the objects that have a tag that is on this list will be ignored.
Added performance degradation option under damage. Engine, steering and sound will only be affected by damage if this option is enabled.
Removed steer smoothing and replaced it with Degrees Per Second Limit which limits the amount of degrees wheels can turn per second. 
Fixed clutch being applied while braking in 1st gear and going forward.
Improved gear skipping in auto gearbox.
Skidmarks sometimes not drawn.
Skidmarks sometimes drawn in air / over other objects.
Improved response to drivetrain RPM changes.
Sand and grass in the demo scene now have their own friction presets. Previously they incorrectly used gravel friction curve.
Improved skidmark alpha calculation.
[WC3D] Changed the way forward friction coefficient affects the forces. Increasing the coefficient will no longer increase the torque but rather the torque limit before slipping which is correct.
[WC3D] Big improvements to the general feel of Wheel Controller.
[WC3D] Fixed spring length difference between single and multiple ray modes.
[WC3D] Fixed wheel stops spinning if not powered as soon as it loses contact with surface.
[WC3D] Fixed bottoming out calculation.
[WC3D] Gizmos are only drawn when object selected to reduce clutter.
[WC3D] Fixed problem with ground detection not happening at the lateral center of the wheel when side resolution was 1, but rather to the side.
[WC3D] Scan ignore layer is now assigned through a multiple choice dropdown.

1.3 
[WC3D]  Support for calipers and other non-rotating objects that move with the wheel but do not rotate.
Added example script for setting up a vehicle at runtime.
Fixed errors when initializing the script at runtime from another script.
Fixed ‘Trailer tag not found’ error when Trailer tag does not exist.
Fixed possible errors with standard assets because Unity importer fails to import standard asset  dependencies when importing required standard assets.
Visual improvements to the demo scene.
Improved speed limiter.
Other minor fixes and changes.

1.2
Replace semi truck with GR3D’s model.
Added power reduction option for trucks with no trailer.

Horn sound.
Manual clutch not working properly with manual transmission.
[WC3D]  Wheels locked up when in neutral on a decline / incline with no user input.
Handbrake coefficient set to 0 on all axles on some of the vehicles.
Revlimiter not causing fuel to cut off / no speed limit per gear.
All cameras on playground (mobile) scene are set to disabled.
Manual transmission sometimes ignores the input.

When using multiple trailers some of the trailers might not show attach prompt.
Brakes toggling between on and off state when standing still under braking.
Incorrect default clutch engagement curve.
Fixed reverse gear ordering when gears list is constructed.
Added missing tooltip explanations for trailer custom inspector.
Added shift safeguards for manual transmission when going from forward to reverse gears and other way around.
