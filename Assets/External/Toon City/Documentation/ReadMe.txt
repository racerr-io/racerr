Thank you for purchasing Toon City!

Version 1.0:

The assets are very simple to use, just drag and drop one of the prefabs into the scene.
Objects are easy to place in the scene if you use vertex snapping, or if you use a 1x1 grid 
placement system.

All models come with centered pivot points at the base.

The naming convention uses the “.L” and “.R” suffixes 
for wheels and objects that may be animated on the left-hand side and right-hand side respectively.
Example: the wheel on the front right of a vehicle uses the name "Wheel_F.R”

Each model uses the toon shader, taken from the standard assets folder.
The textures used by the material are very small in size: the diffuse 
texture is 128*128 and the ramp texture is just 128*4.

Some of the objects have moving parts, such as animated lights, animated doors, etc.
It's easy to edit their position and rotation, by selecting them from the objects’ hierarchy.

The “Demo_Scene_2” has some empty spaces in the city, those are for further updates in the future.

In addition to the graphic assets, there have been added 2 scripts to help you rotate or move objects
 in the scene during play.

For example, attach the “Prop Movement Script” to one of the clouds, check the movement box, give it 
some coordinates and a speed value and watch it float! :)
